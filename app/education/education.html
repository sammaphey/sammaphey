              <h4>Projects</h4>
              <p><span>Assembly Language: </span> Projects that included taking user input and correctly classifying user input to be either a palindrome or not a palindrome. I added a little
                extra flare to the project in creating a "randomly" generated set of answers when user in put was a palindrome. For example "racecar" might print "The name is Drome, Palin Drome"</p>
              <p><span>Java: </span> This class mainly focused on desigining abstract data types inculding stacks, trees, and queues. We designed these in
                an object oriented method and implemented these data storing types in projects through the semester. One such project involved creating a management platform for a restaraunt.
                This leveraged the queue that we designed and tracked the amount of users that entered the store as well as the time spent at each register ordering food.
                While this projects scope included only taking input from the command prompt I created a Graphical User Interface to make it look and feel more realistic.</p>
              <p><span>C++: </span> As the introduction to programming class I spent much of my time in here learning the basis of programming. Still this involved
                the creation of receipts based on what a user was buying.</p>
              <p><span>HTML: </span> The basis of this class was to create a static HTML website (no connection to a server). To design this we strictly used HTML and CSS.
                While this class did not focus on much of the intricacies that come with designing websites I did learn a lot of HTML and CSS from creating a site that explained
                the Star Wars universe.</p>
