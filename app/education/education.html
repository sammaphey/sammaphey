              <p><span>Assembly Language: </span> Projects that included taking user input and correctly classifying user input to be either a palindrome or not a palindrome. I added a little
                extra flare to the project in creating a "randomly" generated set of answers when user in put was a palindrome. For example "racecar" might print "The name is Drome, Palin Drome"</p>
