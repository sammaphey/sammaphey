            I am interested in making the world a better place. That comes with a lot of baggage though doesn't it? What makes me think that I can make the world a better place considering everyone thinks there ideas are correct? I don't think I can answer this question
            and I think that it would be ungracious and disrespectful to others if I tried. These difficult questions that have no answer are what trouble me most and I find that often times I struggle trying to comprehend the complexity of them. But
            I think this gives me an advantage over others who are more rigid in their confidence with respect to the question of how can I make the world a better place. It means that I am malleable, I am still trying to wind my way towards the sun.
            So I am not looking for anything specific in a new position, I am looking for everything. I am looking for a way to push myself closer to the answer of my question. And if there is some part of your business that can aid in my search then
            I will happily join you in trying to make the world a better place.
