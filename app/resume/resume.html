            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
            <p><span>Software Development (Intern):</span> NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland Ohio (2017)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>NASA Glenn’s Materials division has been attempting to implement a digital culture for many years following the industry trend towards using data management systems to produce products more efficiently. I developed a package written in
                    Python to facilitate the use of these data management systems. This included designing a user interface to export information into specific and unique file types, along with an API to allow for importing resultant data. Resulted in
                    an increased use of Glenn’s data infrastructure by materials engineers along with the references at 1 conference.

            <p><span>Web Development (Intern):</span> NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland Ohio (Spring 2017) </p>
            <ul>
                <li>NASA Glenn’s web infrastructure is based on outdated and proprietary technologies that no longer fits the needs of NASA. I worked on a team that began developing web applications using the MEAN stack to help NASA Glenn have more modern
                    web development standards. This included designing two applications to display the advantages of a new framework over the old and outdated one. In addition, we implemented the use of an Agile development method to quickly display the
                    product to our stakeholders. Resulted in a presentation to the Chief Information Officer and the use of more relevant web development techniques at NASA Glenn.
