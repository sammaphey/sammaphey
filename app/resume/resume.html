      <h3>Work Experience</h3>
      <p><span>Software Development (Intern):</span> NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland Ohio (Fall-Spring 2017)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>NASA Glenn’s Materials division has been attempting to implement a digital culture for many years following the industry trend towards using data management systems to produce products more efficiently. I developed a package written in Python
          to facilitate the use of these data management systems. This included designing a user interface to export information into specific and unique file types, along with an API to allow for importing resultant data. Resulted in an increased use
          of Glenn’s data infrastructure by materials engineers along with references at the Materials and Data Management Consortium's Winter 2017 Conference.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span>Web Development (Intern):</span> NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland Ohio (Spring 2017) </p>
      <ul>
        <li>NASA Glenn’s web infrastructure is based on outdated and proprietary technologies that no longer fits the needs of NASA. I worked on a team that began developing web applications using the MEAN stack to help NASA Glenn leverage more modern web
          development standards. This included designing multiple applications to display the advantages of a new framework over the old and outdated one. In addition, we implemented the use of an Agile development method to quickly display the product
          to our stakeholders. Resulted in a presentation to the Chief Information Officer and the use of more relevant web development techniques at NASA Glenn.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span>MEAN Stack Web Development Team Lead (Intern):</span> NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland Ohio (Summer 2017) </p>
      <ul>
        <li>From previous work at NASA Glenn more customers came to the web development team looking to update or create a more modern look and feel to their outdated systems. Given that summers involve heavy intern involvement with Glenn offices my mentor
          put me in charge of a group or four students whose goals were to begin the process of redesigning web sites. This involved heightened awareness of what members of my team were building and designing. Instructing those who had no knowledge of MEAN stack web development.
          As well as regular presentations to our stakeholders, showing them the progress we had made. Resulted in heavier use of the MEAN stack at Glenn, a presentation at the Materials Data Management Consortium's Summer 2017 Conference, and new cooperation bewteen NASA Glenn and the Air Force Research Lab.</li>
